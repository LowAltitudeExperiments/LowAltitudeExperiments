# 🛰️ Low-Altitude Emission Experiments

## 📘 Project Description

This repository contains the **scripts** and **procedures** used to generate the plots included in the **proposal**,  
which will serve as the foundation for the upcoming **scientific papers**.

It includes three **main projects**, dedicated to **low-altitude flight experiments (5–35 km)**,  
focusing on different types of emissions:

- 💠 **Cherenkov emission** — *Responsibility: Caterina Trimarelli*  
- 📡 **Radio emission** — *Responsibility: Abhijit Roy*  
- ⚡ **X-ray emission** — *Responsibility: Rodrigo Torres*

## 📂 Repository Structure & Reproducibility

Each main project will be organized in its own directory,  
and **each folder will include a dedicated README** describing the analysis workflow, data sources, and computational steps.  

This structure is designed to ensure **full reproducibility of the results**.  
All scripts will be **well-documented**, with **detailed explanations** of the implemented methods, parameters, and expected outputs.

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Execution

Each project folder will contain detailed instructions for:

- 🖥️ **Local setup and execution** — environment configuration, dependencies, and example commands.  
- 🧮 **Cluster deployment** — job submission scripts, environment modules, and scalability notes.

This ensures that all analyses can be reproduced both on **personal systems** and **high-performance computing clusters**.

## ⚖️ Licensing & Acknowledgments

Every code module will include its **own license file**, specifying the usage and distribution terms applicable to that part of the project.  

In addition, **previous contributors** whose work has been integrated or adapted will be **explicitly credited** within the corresponding project folder,  
to ensure proper acknowledgment of all contributions.
